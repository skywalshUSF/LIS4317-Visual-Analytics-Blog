1.  Open the dataset and explore the two columns: Average Position and Time.

I used the Module # 5.xlsx file provided in the instructions and opened it in Microsoft Excel to view the data, including the average position and time columns.

2.  Use Plot.ly to:

Create at least one Ranking Chart (e.g., ordered bar chart, slope chart).

At least one Part-to-Whole Chart (e.g., pie chart, stacked bar chart, donut chart).

2.  Think about how these two design frameworks (Ranking and Part-to-Whole) reveal insights in your data.

The first visualization is a stacked bar chart that uses a ranking design framework to show how average position changes across 20 observations. Each bar is split into two different legend colors: orange, which is time, and blue, which represents average position. By stacking them, the chart makes it easy to compare the role of time progression against the variation in average position. The Ranking design of the bar chart is showing a sequential order. Each bar builds on the previous one, reinforcing the idea or concept of progression and cumulative growth.

The second visualization is a pie chart that uses a part-to-whole design framework to reveal insight about the data through Average Position by Time. The entire circle represents the complete dataset, which includes all observations and their average positions. Each slice represents the influence of a Time label, an Average Position value, and a Time percentage. By looking at the size of each slice, I can easily see which values had a larger or smaller share of the overall average positions.

A quick reflection: What are the strengths and limitations of Part-to-Whole as a design framework?


I selected the Module # 5.xlsx dataset for the Ranking visualization because it was easily accessible on the Canvas assignment page. For the Ranking design framework, a stacked bar chart is used because it allows the viewer to compare values across ordered observations while also clearly showing the progression along the ranked sequence of twenty observations. For the story and insight that it tells, the visualization shows that both time and average position increase steadily over 20 observations, with the blue piece (Average Position) stacked on top of the orange piece (Time). This makes it clear that average position improves consistently as time moves forward. The strengths of Ranking as a design framework are that it makes sequential order and progression easy to interpret and analyze, and it is effective for showing growth patterns. The limitations of Ranking as a design framework are that exact values may be harder to read compared to line charts and scatterplots, and proportions can be misinterpreted if two colors stacked on one bar share the same size in common.


I selected the Module # 5.xlsx dataset for the Part-to-Whole visualization because it was easily accessible on the Canvas assignment page. For the Ranking design framework, a pie chart is used because it effectively shows how each  time interval contributes to the overall average position dataset. For the story and insight that it tells, the visualization shows that some time intervals account for a larger portion of the overall average position, while others are influenced by only a small fraction. This provides insight into the distribution of average positions across time, showing which periods were most influential in having a certain effect on the total outcome. The strengths of Part-to-Whole as a design framework are that it clearly communicates proportions and it is easy to see both the balance and imbalance in the data. The limitations of Part-to-Whole as a design framework are that it is difficult to see the smallest slices on the chart and it is not as effective for showing trends or changes over time as I thought it would.

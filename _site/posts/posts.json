In this post, I started by setting up my LIS4317 course blog.\r\nhttps://lis4317-visual-analytics-blog.netlify.app/\r\nFirst Blog Post: Select & Analyze a Visualization\r\nHere is a visualization of a global population addressing global drought risks using index score legends to indicate the level of risk.\r\n\r\nFleck, A. (2025). Mapping Global Drought Risk [Image]. Statista. https://www.statista.com/chart/25101/countries-by-drought-risk/\r\nAccording to the data visualization, I believe that it was created by a human designer and not generated by AI. My reasoning behind this is that in the website source, there is an author name, along with a publishing date, author email, website name, and a source name in the image, which are attributes that belong to a human designer. I also recognize that the decimal scales for each level of the drought risk are specific and that there could still be some bias found. The only ways this visualization could be created by AI was if the human designer tried to use some guided information from the AI to structure the image properly or if they had an AI reference link.\r\nReadings\r\nI have successfully visited the required chapters to read that were listed in this assignment.\r\nSyllabus Review\r\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the syllabus, I confirm that I understand all crucial information specified on it, especially the course structure, grading, and peer- review process. When I read the course description, I started to look forward to use certain platforms that weâ€™ll focus on in this class, such as Tableu, Plotly, Google Sheets, open-source R, and Python. I also got to have a really close look at the course topics, and I found it interesting that most of the topics listed have a connection to statistics. I also fully understand the grading breakdown, policies, and student learning outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
